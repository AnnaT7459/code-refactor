# Code Refactor

## 
This Code Refactor was created for a marketing agency to make their webpage meet accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. I wanted to be able to view the source code and find semantic HTML elements. Additionally, I wanted those HTML elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I wanted to have alternative attributes to make the image elements more accessible. I learned how to put heading attributes in a sequential order. I also renamed the title of the webpage to be concise and descriptive.

I incorrectly cloned the starter code repository, so I have Xander Rapstine (Xandromus) and George (Georgeyoo) as contributors to my repository.
